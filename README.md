#Inventine Software project

 #Inventine : 
 A web platform to connect all creators who are looking for funds for their projects and investors who are looking for new ideas to invest.

 A project description:
     Most of the innovators failing to initiate their project due to lack of seed funding.
     In other hand, potential investors shy away from the riskiness of supporting innovation and prefer to invest in routine productions.
     There is need for a easily accessible platform to enable innovators to raise funds and investors to  have more convenient ways 
     to fund by communicating with creators…


     So this web application for creators and investors to come in and find what they need. 
     Creators can put forward their projects and if there are investors who like the idea they can invest in that project. 
     All the transactions between user can be done via online transfers so it’s easy to use.
